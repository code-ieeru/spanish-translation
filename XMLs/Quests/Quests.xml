It contained descriptions of a ritual to create a spirit of vengeance – a ritual the woman named Alyssa must surely have used to turn herself into the so called ‘Ghost of Greywall’.\n\nAccording to Jorune, the book also described a way to ‘bind’ the ghost in order to vanquish it. However, the description of the items required to perform the ritual are personally related to the ghost, thus we cannot know what we’re looking for without knowing Alyssa’s past first.\n\nWhile the souls trapped within the dungeon are too mad to tell anything reliable, some of the guards may have left behind writings from an earlier time.

According to the ritual spellbook that I found, the ritual items needed are 'a token from one whom they loved', 'the skull of their worst nemesis' and 'a boon from those who blessed them'.\n\nThankfully I managed to find diaries written from before the curse by guards of the Greywall Dungeons, which shed light on Alyssa’s past and how she became the Ghost of Greywall.\n\nIt seems Alyssa’s worst nemesis in life was the Warden of Greywall Dungeons himself, Drawyn Spear, who became obsessed with tormenting her. His wraith rages on in his office within the staff quarters of the dungeons – it seems time I depart him from his skull.\n\nAlyssa’s husband was also written to have perished within Greywall Dungeons. Guard Bod's diary mentions having buried him by a large boulder near the edge of the woods, somewhere at the outskirts of the dungeons. If I were to take a shovel and search for this location, I may be able to recover an appropriate 'token' for the ritual.\n\nFinally, the 'boon from those who blessed them' refers to the authors of the cursed spellbook, whom I learnt from the diaries to mean none other than the Witches of the Silvermirror Fen.
